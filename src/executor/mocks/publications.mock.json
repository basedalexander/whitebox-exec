Here's why UGC 2.0 or 'User-Generated Collects' will be the next evolution of this format unlocked by the blockchain.\n\nI have been posting snippets here on Lenster the last few weeks about these themes as I framed out my article. \n\nHere is the final piece: **https://mirror.xyz/chrissyb.eth/r0SyE9QdvQribykjXvdMqYElGQT8ZFnthV_rUlyNqNk**\n\n#LMCC\n\nInspired by the following people: @ladidaix, @ryanfox, @bellosights (@levychain), @stani and @azeem.\n\n**Cliff notes:**\n\nIn today's one-directional social media interactions, \"likes'' are abundant & meaningless when it comes to generating authentic connections or content discovery. Instead of simply liking something, we would rather participate.\n\nUGC 2.0 is not just a new format, it will revolutionize social media by unlocking far-reaching effects on content consumption than its predecessor. Collectable social content will enrich our experiences and create new forms of digital engagement between creators and users alike.\n\nBy giving creators and users ownership & control of their content without the impediments of gatekeepers they can leverage it into new opportunities across fandom, community connectivity, curation, data and monetization.\n\nCreators aren‚Äôt defined by one platform or medium anymore. The creators, curators and communities of tomorrow will be empowered by data transparency aggregated across the entire social ecosystem without the gatekeepers and centralized databases of today. A more sustainable environment for the long tail and micro-creator to flourish as a result. Indexing less on numbers such as reach and likes, instead providing the tools to focus on quality and depth of relationship and content.¬†\n\nIt will also mark the future of brand creation. Changing how brands interact with consumers as active participants in their own social consumption.\n\nThis is what @lensprotocol strives for. I hope this piece helps scratch the surface and inspires creators, users and builders to explore the possibilities.",
